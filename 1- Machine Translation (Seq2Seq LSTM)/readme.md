# Machine Translation with LSTM

Machine translation is one interesting application in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Here, we implement a translator machine (German to English) using LSTMs. 

Most ideas in this notebook are inspired by [Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215).
